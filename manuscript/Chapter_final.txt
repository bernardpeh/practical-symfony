# Final Chapter: Conclusion

Congratulations for perservering for so long... It's been a long journey. In the previous chapters, we have created a simple CMS using a [modular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_design) approach in Symfony. The CMS is *really simple* but is secure, supports user logging and internalisation.  While going through the exercises, we have explored different possibilities to create parts of the CMS.

So, what's next from here? Ready for more adventures?

Here are some suggestions:

* Improve on the NestablePageBundle to reduce the amount of work required to integrate with EasyAdminBundle.

* Create API for 3rd party services to connect to.

* Add ecommerce capability to the CMS by adding a payment module.

* Improve on look and feel. The frontend still looks ugly.

* Investigate the best practices to deploy your application to a reliable server and configure the production settings.

* What if your application becomes popular and you are getting a lot of traffic? What are the options to optimise your application?

* What about configuring cron jobs to clean up user logging table?

* How about packing your application up into an installable bundle? That way, you can distribute your application easily.

Good luck on your next Symfony Journey!
