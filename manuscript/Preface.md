# Preface

This is a book documenting the creation of [SongBird](https://github.com/bernardpeh/songbird), a simple CMS created using [Symfony Full Stack](http://symfony.com/projects/symfonyfs) which itself consists of many [Symfony Components](http://symfony.com/components). Although the resources in symfony.com is great, they are often hard to digest and you need to piece all the code snippets up to build something useful. I wanted to write an application that covers different aspects of Symfony as much as possible. I believe this approach will be helpful for people who are new to Symfony. This idea was conceptuaised in early 2015 but the implementation turned out to be much longer that I thought - I had to upgrade Symfony from 2 to 3 and dropped SonataAdmin in favor of EasyAdmin when I was 90% done.

The project was finally completed in Aug 2016 after much persistence and has gone through several revisions since.

The objective of this project is to:

* Illustrate the power of rapid development with Symfony.

* Reduce the learning curve by sharing step-by-step guide to create a working application. This process should be helpful to anyone who wants to dive into Symfony.

* Kickstart simple Symfony projects with this application.

* Share the fun of programming.

It is important to note that the rationale behind SongBird CMS is to have broad coverage. Therefore, I try not to repeat the same techniques in every chapter. In reality, you might find some techniques work really well and will want to keep reusing them. On the other hand, you might find certain implementations overkill. This is all for learning purpose.   

I hope you have fun creating your own version of SongBird by following the exercises in this book, choosing your best arsenal for your future adventures.

Cheers,
Bernard Peh
