# Preface

This is a book documenting the creation of [SongBird](https://github.com/bernardpeh/songbird), a simple CMS created using [Symfony Full Stack](http://symfony.com/projects/symfonyfs) which itself consists of many [Symfony Components](http://symfony.com/components). The idea was conceptualised in early 2015 but the implementation turned out to be much harder that I thought. I had to upgrade Symfony from 2 to 3 and dropped SonataAdmin in favor of EasyAdmin when I was 90% done.

The project was finally completed in Aug 2016 after much persistence. Even though there is much more to be done such as fixing typos and grammatical errors, I believe the book is ready to meet the world and collect feedback.

I started this project to:

* Illustrate the power of rapid development with Symfony.

* Reduce the learning curve by sharing step-by-step guide to create a working application. This process should be helpful to anyone who wants to dive into Symfony.

* Kickstart simple Symfony projects with this application.

* Share the fun of programming.

* Have fun!

I hope you have fun creating your own version of SongBird.
