# Chapter 4: The Testing Framework Part 1 (Optional)

This chapter talks about [Codeception](http://codeception.com/). Feel free to skip it if you already have a testing framework in place.

No application is complete without going through a rigorous testing process. Software Testing is a big topic by itself.

Today, many developers know [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development). Test First Development ensures that your software is reliable but requires a lot of patience and extra work to implement it correctly. Think of it like a quality control process. The more checks you have, the less bugs your have. Of course, you can cost cut by not having checks and hope that your product is still bug free. This is quite unlikely especially if the software is complex.

Personally, I prefer to write user stories and scenarios first rather than spending time coding the tests. Think of them as pseudocode. Once we have the user stories and scenarios defined, we will jump in and code functionality A. When functionality A is completed, we will code the test cases and ensure they pass before moving on. We will repeat the cycle for functionality B before moving on to functionality C. The idea is to not break existing functionalities while adding on new functionalities.

Everyone's testing approach is different. You could implement your own approach.

There are many frameworks for acceptance testing. [Behat](http://docs.behat.org/) and [Mink](http://mink.behat.org/) are the industrial standard at the moment. In this book, we will be using [Codeception](http://codeception.com/) to write acceptance tests in most cases. We will also be writing some functional test in phpunit.

## Installation

```
-> cd symfony
-> composer require codeception/codeception --dev
```

The "--dev" means we only need this in dev mode. If everything is working, you will see composer adding the dependency in composer.json

```
# composer.json

# add the codeception line under require-dev
"require-dev": {
    ...
    "codeception/codeception": "^2.2"
},
```

Now we can initialise codeception

```
-> vendor/bin/codecept bootstrap
```

Let us configure the acceptance test.

```
# symfony/tests/acceptance.suite.yml
class_name: AcceptanceTester
modules:
    enabled:
        - WebDriver:
            url: 'http://songbird.app:8000'
            browser: phantomjs
            window_size: 1024x768
            capabilities:
                unexpectedAlertBehaviour: 'accept'
                webStorageEnabled: true
        - \Helper\Acceptance
```

Acceptance Testing is like Black Box Testing - We try to simulate real users interacting with our app. We ignore the inner workings of the code and only care if it works from the end user's point of view.

Here, we are using [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org) webdriver to simulate browser testing. Codeception by default comes with PhpBrowser which doesn't support javascript. [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) is slow but is the veteran when comes to acceptance testing. Feel free to switch to selenium if you encounter problems.

We can now generate the acceptance actions based on the updated acceptance suite:

```
-> vendor/bin/codecept build

# we will now get all the codecept libraries for free

Building Actor classes for suites: acceptance, functional, unit
 -> AcceptanceTesterActions.php generated successfully. 0 methods added
\AcceptanceTester includes modules: WebDriver, \Helper\Acceptance
 -> FunctionalTesterActions.php generated successfully. 0 methods added
\FunctionalTester includes modules: \Helper\Functional
 -> UnitTesterActions.php generated successfully. 0 methods added
\UnitTester includes modules: Asserts, \Helper\Unit
```

## The First Test

We know that the default Symfony comes with the AppBundle example. Let us now test the bundle by creating a test suite for it.


```
-> vendor/bin/codecept generate:cest acceptance AppBundle
```

The auto generated Cest class should look like this:

```
# symfony/tests/acceptance/AppBundleCest.php

class AppBundleCest
{
    public function _before(AcceptanceTester $I)
    {
    }

    public function _after(AcceptanceTester $I)
    {
    }

   ...
}
```

Let us write our own test. All new Symfony installation homepage should have a successful message.


```
# symfony/tests/acceptance/AppBundleCest.php
...
# replaced tryToTest function with InstallationTest function
public function InstallationTest(AcceptanceTester $I)
{
    $I->wantTo('Check if Symfony is installed successfully.');
    $I->amOnPage('/');
    $I->see('Welcome to');
}
```

Now run the test:

```
-> vendor/bin/codecept run acceptance AppBundleCest
```

and you should get an error complaining that there is no selenium server or PhantomJS running...

```
1) AppBundleCest: Check if Symfony is installed successfully.
 Test  tests/acceptance/AppBundleCest.php:InstallationTest
Can't connect to Webdriver at http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub. Please make sure that Selenium Server or PhantomJS is running.

ERRORS!
Tests: 1, Assertions: 0, Errors: 1.
```

Download [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) and unzip. Remember to start run the phantomjs command in a **new terminal**.

```
-> cd symfony
-> mkdir scripts
-> cd scripts
# download phantomjs to this dir. In a new terminal, start selenium server. I am using v2.53.1 for example.
-> chmod u+x phantomjs 
-> ./phantomjs --webdriver=4444

[INFO  - 2017-01-20T05:36:49.610Z] GhostDriver - Main - running on port 4444
```

On the previous terminal, run the acceptance test again. You should see the phantomjs terminal showing lots of logsand running the test.

```
-> vendor/bin/codecept run acceptance AppBundleCest

```

Some files such as images are binary. To make life easy, we are going to commit phantomjs. We need to tell git not to convert the line endings (google for it if interested)

```
# .gitattributes

...
# Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified.
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
```

Don't forget to commit your code before moving on to the next chapter.

```
-> git add symfony
-> git commit -m"added codeception and created basic test"
# update remote repo so you dont lose it
-> git push -u origin my_chapter4
```

## Summary

In this chapter, we discussed the importance of testing and touched on TDD and BDD. In our context, we will be mainly writing BDD tests. We installed codeception and phantomjs. Then, we wrote a simple acceptance test to tests the default symfony home page.

## Exercises (Optional)

* Try configure codeception to allow the running of different acceptance testing profiles. Can you test with PhpBrowser or selenium easily? Do you see any benefit of doing that? See [advanced codeception](http://codeception.com/docs/07-AdvancedUsage) for help.
